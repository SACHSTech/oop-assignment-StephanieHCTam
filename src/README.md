## Summary
This program models a swim registration. The user is a patron who would like to register for a swim program at a Markham Community Center. The user is prompted to input their personal information; then select: a community center pool, the type of swim program (parent classes), and the specific swim program (subclasses). 

The program provides information of the selected community center pool such as the pool name, address and aquatic features. Depending on the user's inputted age, the program determines the color wristband that they will receive. Based on the user's selected swim program, the program determines what type of staff is needed. 

At the end, the swim registraction program restates all the information selected and inputted by the user, and notifies them that the information will be emailed to the email they provided.

The user will go through each level of swim program hierarchy with inheritance/abstract or aggregation relationship. The specific swim programs (Public/Private Swim) are subclasses to store swim programs that are extensions of a more general (Swim Programs) parent class.
